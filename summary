Hello Fred,Please find attached the Python script for the RCC Chemicals. I believe Jen's idea of including "Curr" at the beginning of the tab name is excellent and should work well. Using a wildcard like "Curr*" to pick up the tab name is a practical approach, and I am confident it will be effective.Thank you for the heads up about the ABL file for the other RCCs. We will make sure to incorporate the ABL file and ABL fcls as we move forward with other RCCs. We understand that the Chemicals file does not have an ABL sub-cap broken out, and we will take this into account in our future work.Regarding the stretch goal of having Python handle all the formulas currently managed by Excel, we agree that it would be a valuable improvement. Automating the formulas for Curr/Prev, Issuer Risk, Financing, trend, etc., would not only streamline the process for users but also ensure consistency across all RCCs. We will consider this a "nice to have" feature and explore its feasibility in our ongoing development.We look forward to future working group sessions and continuing our collaborative efforts. Again, great work everyone, and thank you for your guidance and support.Best regards,
