Hi ,
I wanted to share a brief update on the SCU SharePoint project.
Over the past weeks, I have redesigned the SCU SharePoint experience with a focus on usability and clarity for end users. The most visible change is a new, cleaner data entry form, replacing the standard SharePoint form with a customized interface that is easier to navigate, better organized, and more intuitive for the team.
The new form clearly groups information by topic, improves how comments and narrative fields are entered, and reduces confusion around mandatory fields. From a user perspective, the process of registering and updating SCU accounts is now more structured, faster, and visually clearer than before.
Behind the scenes, I also rebuilt the list structure to support this improved experience, ensuring the form works reliably and that data is captured consistently over time.
At this stage, the new SharePoint list and form are complete and published, and the user-facing experience is in place.
Next steps are to migrate historical data from the previous SharePoint into the new structure. This will require some data preparation, which I am planning to complete by the end of the week, with the goal of having the full solution ready next week.
Before rolling it out to the full team, I recommend having 2–3 users test the new SharePoint and provide feedback. If helpful, we can also schedule a walk-through of the new SharePoint next week.
Regards,
