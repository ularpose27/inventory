After reviewing both files, here are my comments:

1. In the Ratings Activity Report, I filtered out entries with "GBM" in the "Business" column, leaving 61 records. In comparison, the WMR Deteriorating CRR Report contains 64 records â€” that is, 3 more than the Ratings Activity Report.


2. The WMR Deteriorating CRR Report includes two additional customer names not present in the Ratings Activity Report: Millitobanki and WFGHowni.


3. The third additional customer is Armikii, whose record includes both GBM and CMB facilities.
