Dear Jen,
I hope you're doing well.

Thank you very much for your feedback—it’s truly appreciated. I believe it would be helpful to review the process related to the ABL facilities together, as the current procedure I’m following for completing the RCC is not entirely clear to me.

Please let me know if you’d like me to schedule a meeting, or feel free to schedule one at your convenience.

I’ve also taken note of your point regarding the removal of GBM and CMB mentions and will make sure to apply that going forward.

Best regards,
Armando
