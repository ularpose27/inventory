Reflecting on 2024, my first full year with HSBC, I am proud of the strides I’ve made in both learning and contributing to our team. Upon being assigned my first reporting responsibilities, I quickly familiarized myself with the requirements and immediately began to identify areas for improvement. Within the first month of working with these reports, I took the initiative to automate one of them using Python, marking it as the first report in our team to be automated in this way. This achievement not only streamlined our processes but also set a precedent for further automation within the team.

Building on this success, my colleague Eduardo and I embarked on a more ambitious project: the RCC automation. This larger-scale initiative allowed us to apply the skills and insights gained from our initial automation efforts, aiming to make our processes more efficient and reliable on a broader scale. Our work on the RCC automation project has led to significant time savings, reduced manual errors, and increased the consistency and accuracy of our reports.

Additionally, participating in HSBC’s Python Clinic this year was instrumental in advancing our technical capabilities. The clinic refreshed my Python skills and introduced me to new techniques, which proved invaluable as we tackled automation projects. Collaborating with the Data Analytics team during the clinic further enriched our approach, reinforcing the value of cross-functional partnerships and innovative problem-solving.

Looking ahead, I am excited to continue exploring opportunities for automation and process improvements that bring measurable benefits to our team and HSBC as a whole. This year has strengthened my commitment to innovation, and I am eager to take on new challenges that contribute meaningfully to our team’s success.

This version puts a stronger emphasis on your quick automation of the initial report, positioning you as an innovative problem-solver who made an immediate impact on the team. It also highlights the RCC automation project as a key achievement. Let me know if this aligns better with what you’re looking for!
