SCU SharePoint Project – Walkthrough Script
1. Opening and purpose
Thank you for your time. I would like to give you a short walkthrough of the new SCU SharePoint solution I have been working on.
The goal of this project is to improve how we capture and maintain SCU-related information in SharePoint, using modern Microsoft tools that we already have available.
The focus has been on creating a clearer data entry process, improving consistency, and supporting the use of automatically updated customer data.
This is a first version of the solution. Today’s objective is to show how it works, explain the logic behind it, and get your feedback before moving forward.
2. SharePoint homepage
I will start with the SharePoint homepage, which is designed to be the main entry point for the team.
Below the header, I have added action buttons. At the moment, the key one is Create New Entry, which opens the form used to register a new SCU account.
This page is flexible and can be expanded over time. For example, we can add short instructions, announcements, or guidance for the team, depending on what we think is most useful.
3. Opening the entry form
When I click on Create New Entry, a new tab opens with the data entry form.
This form is built using Power Apps and is directly connected to the SCU SharePoint list.
The form is structured to guide the user step by step, instead of showing all fields at once, to make the process clearer and easier to follow.
4. Customer selection and customer snapshot
One of the key elements of the form is the Customer Name selection.
Once a customer is selected, a customer snapshot appears on the right-hand side of the screen.
This snapshot shows relevant customer information such as balances, risk grade, and facility grades, so the user has context while entering the data.
Some of this customer information is also pulled automatically into the SharePoint list. Other fields are shown only for reference and are not stored.
Not all snapshot fields are currently saved. For example, certain balance or exposure values are shown for context, but not captured in the dataset.
This is an area where I would like your feedback, to confirm whether the columns we are storing are the right ones, or if additional information should be included.
5. User fields and directory integration
Fields such as RM Name, Team Lead, and Analyst Name are connected to the company directory.
Users can search and select names directly, which helps keep the data consistent and avoids manual typing.
6. Categories and structure
The form is organized into four main categories.
These categories control which sections are shown and help structure the information in a more logical way.
I would like your feedback on whether these categories make sense from a business perspective, or if they should be adjusted or expanded.
7. New and updated fields
I have also added new fields, such as the Mods field, based on recent discussions and requirements.
The idea is that the form can evolve over time as we confirm what information is actually useful.
8. Validation and submission
At the bottom of the form, there are two main actions: Send and Cancel.
When the user clicks Send, the system checks whether any fields are left empty and displays a message listing those fields.
This does not block submission, but it makes the user aware of what has not been completed.
Here, I would like your input on whether certain fields should be mandatory, or if this warning-based approach is sufficient.
9. Approval and review possibilities
Another potential enhancement is introducing a review or approval step.
For example, after submission, an entry could be reviewed by a Team Lead or a peer before being finalized.
This is something that can be implemented using the Microsoft tools we already have, if it is considered useful.
10. Customer repository and automation
The customer information shown in the snapshot comes from a separate SCU Customer Repository List.
The intention is to keep this list updated automatically using Power Automate, based on a regularly updated Excel file, such as the Daily BO file.
This means that when someone registers a new account, they are working with the most up-to-date customer information available.
I will also explore whether there is a possibility to connect directly to internal systems in the future.
11. Open discussion on improvements
Beyond what you see today, there are several possible enhancements.
These could include notifications, reminders, approval emails, or automated outputs, depending on what would be useful for the team.
At this stage, the most important thing is to confirm that the data we are capturing is the right data and that the process works well in practice.
12. Closing and next steps
To summarize, this solution provides a more structured way to register SCU accounts, gives users better context at the point of entry, and supports the use of updated customer data.
The next step will be importing the existing information into this new SharePoint list. This will require some data preparation, and I am planning to complete this by the end of the week.
After that, I would suggest involving two or three people from the team to test the solution before rolling it out more widely.
If helpful, we can also schedule a walkthrough session next week to review the final setup together.
Feedback questions
Before moving forward, I would appreciate your feedback on the following points:
Do the fields captured in the form cover the information you need, or are there important fields missing
Do the current categories make sense, or would you suggest reorganizing or adding new ones
Are there fields that you believe should be mandatory rather than optional
Would an approval or review step add value to this process
