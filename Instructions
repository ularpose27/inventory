Now that 2025 is coming to an end, it is important to reflect on what this year has been at HSBC. In general, I’ve had another amazing year at the bank, continuing with many of the activities from the previous year while also taking on new challenges and responsibilities.

During this year, I had the opportunity to manage the Chemicals and Retail RCC processes. At the beginning, these tasks were quite challenging, but over time I became very familiar with them and developed strong expertise, receiving positive feedback from the stakeholders involved.

In addition, I continued improving other processes that relied on legacy tools such as Access, and I successfully migrated them to Python to make them more efficient and easier to maintain.

Looking ahead, I feel very excited about my new role in the Special Credit Unit (SCU). I plan to use my experience in data manipulation and automation with Python to help make reporting more efficient and deliver solid results, just as I did in my previous position.
