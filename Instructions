Hello Fred,
I hope you're doing well.

I reviewed the April 2025 data shared by Swagatika, along with the March 2025 file she kindly provided. After running the New Money Report process, I obtained results that are nearly identical to those from the "Daily BO New Money" process.

Based on this, I approve the Qlik Sense query from my side, as it includes the necessary columns to support the New Money process. Please note that my approval assumes the HSI facilities—those with a "Facility Type Code" starting with "H"—have been correctly filtered out by Swagatika within the Qlik Sense query.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Best regards,
Armando
