2024 Self-Assessment

Reflecting on 2024, my first full year with HSBC, I am grateful for the opportunities I’ve had to learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully to our team’s goals. As I immersed myself in the company’s culture and processes, I quickly took on responsibilities for multiple reports, gaining a deep understanding of our data management and reporting systems. Early in the year, I began to identify potential areas for improvement, focusing especially on enhancing efficiency and exploring possibilities for automation.

A major highlight this year was my participation in HSBC’s Python Clinic. This experience was invaluable, providing me with fresh insights into advanced Python techniques that could drive further improvements in our work. The clinic also fostered collaboration across departments, especially with the Data Analytics team, expanding my perspective on cross-functional innovation and equipping me with new ideas for enhancing our reporting processes.

Following the clinic, my colleague Eduardo and I leveraged our updated Python skills to implement automation in key reporting tasks. By streamlining repetitive processes, we achieved significant time savings, reduced potential for error, and enhanced the overall consistency and accuracy of our reports. This project not only underscored the impact of automation but also strengthened my commitment to continuous improvement and innovation within our team.

Looking forward, I am excited about the possibilities for further advancements and am eager to take on new challenges that will contribute to HSBC’s goals. I believe the insights and skills I have gained this year position me well to drive positive change, and I am enthusiastic about continuing to explore innovative solutions that add value to our team and the organization as a whole.

Early in the year, I was assigned responsibility for several reports, which gave me a unique opportunity to learn the intricacies of our data management and reporting systems. Over time, I began to identify areas where improvements could be made, particularly around efficiency and automation.

One of the highlights of this year was participating in HSBC’s Python Clinic. This clinic not only helped me refresh my existing Python skills but also introduced me to new techniques and tools that could drive further improvements in my work. Working with colleagues from other departments, especially Data Analytics, was a valuable experience that strengthened my understanding of cross-departmental collaboration and opened my eyes to new possibilities for innovation.

Following the clinic, my colleague Eduardo and I applied our enhanced Python skills to streamline some of our reporting processes. By automating repetitive tasks, we’ve been able to save time, reduce errors, and increase the overall accuracy and consistency of our reports. This experience has deepened my commitment to continuous improvement and innovation, and I look forward to finding more ways to contribute to the team’s success in the coming years.
