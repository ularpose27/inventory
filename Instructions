At the beginning of the year, my team embarked on an automation project aimed at simplifying the creation of reports across different industries. Our goal was to reduce the time and manual risks associated with traditional processes. To achieve this, we decided to transition from tools like Excel and Access to Python.

Initially, only one person on our team had knowledge of Python. Fortunately, we enrolled in a Python course offered by the Data Analytics team here in Mexico. Eduardo truly took advantage of this opportunity. In the second half of the project, armed with his newfound knowledge, he made significant improvements to the existing code and expanded its application to other industry reports.

Now, Eduardo is consolidating the code for different industries and enhancing the existing codebase. This project is highly significant, as it saves more than half the time compared to manual processes using traditional tools. Eduardo's contributions have been invaluable, and his dedication has greatly impacted our team's success.
