assisted me in extracting the latest information using the original Qlik Sense query. However, the data was only available up to February 3rd, so despite having access to the query, we were unable to retrieve the complete dataset for February.

Since the previous query was not viable, I attempted to use the new RDP. However, this query returned over 27,000 records, whereas I typically expect around 5,000 records.

Additionally, the column structure in this new query differs from the previous one. Specifically, the Facility ID column was removed, making it difficult to identify the HSI facilities that needed to be excluded. To address this, I cross-referenced the data with the RDP Daily BO for February to filter out the necessary records.

Fred, could you advise on the best way to proceed? I would greatly appreciate your input on the following:

Do you know who could assist in reloading the data for the previous query?

Is there someone who could adjust the new RDP query to align it more closely with the previous version?

Do you think it would be possible to filter the current RDP query results to bring the record count closer to the expected 5,000?
