Subject: Update on Data Request

Hello Abhimanyu,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to update you on the status of the data you requested. The necessary report is released around the 9th of each month, and I will need some time afterward to process the data. Given this timeline, I expect to be able to deliver the report by the end of next week.

Please rest assured that I am prioritizing this task and will do my best to expedite the process. I appreciate your understanding and patience.

Thank you, and I will keep you informed of any further updates.

Best regards,  
Armando
