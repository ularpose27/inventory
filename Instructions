Reflecting on this past year, I recognize there are areas where I can further develop my skills and knowledge to make a greater impact in my role. One key area is deepening my understanding of the data sources behind the numbers I work with. While I am proficient in generating reports, I believe gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the background and context behind each dataset will enhance the quality and relevance of my analyses. Additionally, I see an opportunity to strengthen my skills in conflict resolution and team dynamics. This year, we faced a conflict within the team, and I realized that having more refined skills in this area could help me better navigate and even preempt such situations. Moving forward, I am committed to focusing on these areas to enhance my contributions to the team and foster a more cohesive work environment.
