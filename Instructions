Hello Fred,

I hope you are well.

I am working on the CMB report and encountered an issue with the new RDP query. Previously, we used a filter called "Month End Indicator" with two options, "C" and "M." However, the new query includes a filter named "Frequency" with additional options.

I attempted to use the "All Daily" option, but the result was 22,383 records, whereas the previous query returned 22,387 records. I am unsure if I selected the correct option within the new "Frequency" filter or if the new query is expected to have a slight difference in the number of records.

Could you please advise which option I should select in the new filter?

Best regards,
Armando
