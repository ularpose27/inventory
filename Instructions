Hi 

Hope you’re doing well.

Regarding your request on





the current MSR report I have does not explicitly classify relationships as turnaround vs debt recovery, so I’m not able to reproduce that split directly from this dataset.

What I can provide from the MSR is:

the total number of customers in our managed accounts portfolio and the corresponding total exposure, and

within that, the count of customers with exposure below $500k and the aggregate exposure for those customers.


Please let me know if these figures would be helpful for your analysis, or if you’d like me to look into alternative sources for a turnaround vs. debt recovery breakdown.

Best regards,
