I really enjoyed our conversation today and getting to know more about you. That link to your wrestling profile is awesome—really impressive! And those trophies speak for themselves.

The one who's good at soccer is actually Eduardo, so that would probably be our only "strong card" against you—haha. But it sounds like you'd have us beat in just about every other sport!

Looking forward to more chats like this.
